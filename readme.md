# JS backend on steroids

Guide to make and run the ultimate backend on NodeJS or V8.<br />
It's an unfinished developer guide full of typo. Come back later.

## Goals

* You want a server for your microproject, or your proof-on-concept app.
* You want to make it simple.
* You want a small learning time, and also want to ship the product fast.
* You want to test offline.
* You want to go online fast...
* ...without a lot of configurations.
* It's a small project at start, but you want the possibility to scale up to serve the whole world...
* ...without thinking about refactoring, load balancers, servers, encryption, or anything else
* YOU. JUST. WANT. CODE.
* Oh and you want all of it free.

ARE YOU NUTS?
