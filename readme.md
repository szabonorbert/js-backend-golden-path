## Goals

* You want a server for your microproject, or your proof-on-concept app.
* You want to make it simple.
* You want a small learning time, and also want to ship the product fast.
* You want to test offline.
* You want to go online fast...
* ...without a lot of configurations.
* It's a small project at start, but you want the possibility to scale up to serve the whole world...
* ...without thinking about refactoring, load balancers, servers, encryption, or anything else
* YOU. JUST. WANT. CODE.
* Oh and you want all of it free.

ARE YOU NUTS?

No, you are not. It's all possible. Welcome to this tutorial.

## What is this?

It's a developer guide with best practices as I personally see. First I wanted to make a small step-by-step guide just for me, buit I realized I can do a nice tutorial if I add some more comments.

## Requirements
