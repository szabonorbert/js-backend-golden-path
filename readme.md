## Goals

* You want a server for your microproject, or your proof-on-concept app.
* You want to make it simple.
* You want a small learning time, and also want to ship the product fast.
* You want to test offline.
* You want to go online fast...
* ...without a lot of configurations.
* It's a small project at start, but you want the possibility to scale up to serve the whole world...
* ...without thinking about refactoring, load balancers, servers, encryption, or anything else
* YOU. JUST. WANT. CODE.
* Oh and you want all of it free.

ARE YOU NUTS?

No, you are not. It's all possible. Welcome to this tutorial.

## What is this?

It's a developer guide with best practices as I personally see. First I wanted to make a small step-by-step guide just for me, buit I realized I can do a nice tutorial if I add some more comments.

## Requirements

* Basic knowledge of software engineering, JavaScript and cloud concepts. We will not discuss terminology, but use technologies in this guide.
* `node` and `npm` installed in your machine - https://nodejs.org/
* Docker Desktop for running containers - https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

## What are we going to build?

A small backend webapp, with codeing, performance and security best practices. We will make a code that you can run on NodeJS and even on edge platforms, like Cloudflare Workers. This repository is just a bunch of snippets and notes about leverage the core concepts and deploy you software wordwide.

## Part1: your software

### Init

### Hono

### Run

### Recommended upgrades

## Part2: Dockerization for NodeJS

## Part3: Run in the cloud

## Part4: Run as edge function
